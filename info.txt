Library vs Framework
Library: A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks.
eg -> axios(we use it for API sent requests)

Framework: A framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure and guidelines for building software applications.
eg -> express

Express - > It is a Node.js web application framework that provides a flexible way to create web applications.
Used for server side programming.

4 major usage we'll use express for:
1. Listen for incoming requests
2. Parse these requests
3. To match response with routes
4. To send suitable response back to the client.

What is Routing: Routing is the process of selecting a path for taffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.
eg: / or /home -> home page, /about -> about page, /contact -> contact page.
We can send only one response for a same page, can't send multiple responses for a same page.

: Now in this we would also install Nodemon , which is a tool/package that helps us to automatically restart our server whenever 
we make any changes in our code. command for installation -> npm i nodemon.

: Path Parameters : Path parameters are used to pass values to routes. They are used to pass values to routes.
Or we can say Sending variable value with our path is known as path parameters.
